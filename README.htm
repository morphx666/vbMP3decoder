<p><b>What is vbMP3Decoder?</b><br>
Well, as its name suggests it, it's an MP3 decoder written in Visual Basic.<br>
The original Visual Basic 6 code is a port from 
<a href="http://www.kmlager.com/">Krister Lagerström</a>'s C version 
of the decoder and it was made by Murphy McCauley from
<a href="http://www.constantthought.com/project/VBMP3">
http://www.constantthought.com/</a></p>
<p>Murphy's original VB6 code worked perfectly and was able to convert an MP3 
file into a WAV file. I then modified the code so that instead of writing the PCM 
data to a file, it would write it to a DirectSound buffer. Unfortunately, VB6&#39;s 
code was extremely slow -- the CPU resources raised to 100% and the decoder 
wasn't able to play a single MP3 file without skipping.</p>
<p>So, I decided to port the code to VisualBasic.NET 2005 and see if I could 
take advantage of the new array handling routines, among other stuff. After 
playing a bit with the code I have been able to, not only make it work, but to 
reduce the CPU consumption to less than 15%</p>
    <p>Later on I rewrote a lot of the code to take advantage of the new features in 
        recent versions of the .NET, making it simpler, clearer and even faster.</p>
<p><b>What can I use this for?</b><br>
To learn...<br>
The speed and quality of the decoder are not optimal for production use so I 
suggest you use this code to learn, and of course, to admire how VB has evolved!</p>
<p><b>Is it free? Can I use it on my own applications?</b><br>
I guess... perhaps you should ask Murphy and see under what terms he is 
distributing his code.</p>
